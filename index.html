		    <h1> Introduction: AI tools </h1> 
				<p> This presentation will address the profound transformation occurring in technical communication, driven by the rapid development and adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. While AI promises significant productivity and consistency benefits, it also poses clear threats to the role of the technical writer as it currently exists. To thrive, writers must evolve from content producers to strategic partners, designers, and curators.
					</p> 
<p>AI tools threaten the current structure of the technical writing profession by automating core functions and altering market expectations.
</p>
<p>The primary danger stems from the automation of routine writing tasks. Modern AI can generate content such as user manuals, API documentation, or release notes from structured input, and can automatically rephrase or localize content. This capability allows organizations to rely on AI for first drafts or even final content for straightforward documentation, thereby reducing the need for human writers to handle repetitive work.
</p> 
<p>
Furthermore, AI is increasingly integrated directly into development pipelines (e.g., GitHub Copilot and Doxygen extensions), allowing developers to produce readable documentation output from code and thus bypassing technical writers entirely for certain documentation types. This efficiency pressure, coupled with AI’s promise of faster turnaround and lower costs, threatens teams under budget constraints, which may lead to downsizing and a shift toward keeping only a few senior writers to oversee AI outputs. Skills that were previously "value-add"—such as automatically enforcing style guides and ensuring content consistency—are also being handled by AI, narrowing the distinction between human expertise and automated documentation. This environment risks the devaluation of entry-level roles, leading to a potential “hollowing out” of the profession as low-complexity tasks are fully automated. </p>

		    <h1> NotebookLM: AI Research and Learning Features </h1>
				<p> NotebookLM is an AI-powered research and content organization tool developed by Google.</p>  
<p> It serves as a personalized AI partner for research and thinking and a notetaking assistant.
Its primary goal is to streamline workflow, enhance learning, boost creativity, and help users make connections and understand complex material faster.

<p class="pt-3">Key characteristics of NotebookLM include:
<ul>
<li>
Source-Grounded AI: Its responses are based only on the sources you upload, which significantly reduces the risk of AI "hallucination".</li>
<li> Curated Resources: Unlike the general Google Gemini app, NotebookLM allows users to handpick and curate exclusive resources. Users can upload up to 50 sources per notebook to create a powerful knowledge hub. </li>
<li>Source Variety: It accepts many types of content, including PDFs, Google Docs, Slides, Markdown files, audio files, websites, YouTube videos (using the text transcript), and copied text. </li>
</ul>
</p>
	
</p>
<p class="pt-3">
The sources highlight six main features that help users actively learn and master subjects:


<p>
	<ol> 
		<h3> <li> Audio Summary </h3>
	While the term "Audio Summary" is not explicitly used as a feature title, NotebookLM offers Audio Overviews, which help users understand material while they are "on the go" . These overviews offer diverse perspectives on the source material . One specific format is the Brief, where a single AI host delivers a short summary of the core ideas contained within the user's sources . Other formats included in Audio Overviews are Critique (two AI hosts offering constructive feedback) and Debate (two AI hosts discussing different perspectives) .
</li>	
		<h3> <li>Video Summary </h3>
	The sources indicate that NotebookLM accepts a wide variety of source materials, including the text transcript from YouTube videos. However, the sources do not detail a dedicated "video summary" feature among the main functionalities of NotebookLM.
</li>
		<h3> <li>Mindmap</h3>
	The provided sources do not contain information detailing a "mindmap" feature or its functionality within the NotebookLM platform.
</li>
		<h3> <li>Report</h3>
	NotebookLM features Upgraded Reports that allow for the instant generation of high-quality documents . Previously, this included Briefing Docs and Study Guides, but the redesigned feature now includes new formats like the Blog Post . The reporting function is dynamic; it suggests output options based on the theme, topic, or industry found in the user’s sources (e.g., suggesting a glossary for an economic article or a character analysis for a short story draft) . Users also have the ability to create new custom formats to generate content tailored to specific needs .
</li>
		<h3> <li>Learning Guide</h3>
	The Learning Guide option functions as a personal tutor directly within NotebookLM . This feature is designed to foster a deeper understanding of the subject by encouraging engagement . Instead of simply providing direct answers, the Learning Guide poses probing, open-ended questions . It also helps users break down problems step-by-step and adapts explanations to individual needs .
</li>
		<h3> <li>Quiz</h3>
	NotebookLM can instantly create study aids, including quizzes (alongside flashcards), directly from uploaded documents, such as lecture notes or research papers . These interactive quizzes are entirely grounded in your sources, helping to ensure accuracy . Users have the ability to customize both the topic and the difficulty level of the quizzes . The platform also offers an "explain" option, which generates a detailed overview to explain why a quiz question was answered incorrectly, complete with citations pointing back to the original source material

<section class="my-5" id="Threats">
<div class="container py-5">
    <h1> Threats to the role of technical writers </h1>
 
 <p>
	 AI tools are already reshaping the landscape for technical writers. While they bring a lot of productivity and consistency benefits, they also pose clear threats to the role as it currently exists.
	 <ol>
 <h3> <li> 🧠 Automation of Routine Writing Tasks</h3>
	 Modern AI tools can:
	 Generate user manuals, API documentation (application programming interface), or release notes from structured input or code comments.
	 Rephrase, summarize, or localize content automatically.
	 <p> <b>Threat</b>: Organizations may rely on AI for first drafts or even final content for straightforward documentation, reducing the need for human writers to handle repetitive or templated work. </p>
		 </li>
 <h3> <li> ⚙️ Integration with Development Pipelines</h3>
	 AI is increasingly integrated directly into developer tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Swagger, Doxygen extensions, and documentation-as-code systems).
	<p> <b>Threat</b>: Developers might use AI-assisted documentation generators to produce readable output directly from code, bypassing technical writers entirely for certain types of documentation (like API references).
	</p>
	 </li>
 <h3> <li> 💸 Cost and Efficiency Pressure</h3>
	 AI tools promise faster turnaround and lower costs compared to human labor.
	 <p> <b>Threat</b>: Companies under budget pressure may downsize writing teams, keeping only a few senior writers to oversee AI outputs instead of full teams doing manual documentation.
	</p> </li>
<h3> <li>🧩 Erosion of “Unique Value” Tasks</h3>
	 AI can now:
	 <ul>
<li> Enforce style guides automatically. </li>
<li> Ensure consistency across documentation.</li>
<li> Translate and localize content with good accuracy.</li>
	 </ul>
	 <p> <b>Threat</b>: These were previously “value-add” skills that set human writers apart. As AI takes over these functions, the distinction between expert and automated documentation narrows.
</p> </li>
 <h3> <li>📉 Devaluation of Entry-Level Roles</h3>
	 AI tools are often used to handle low-complexity documentation, which traditionally helped new writers gain experience.
	 <p> <b>Threat</b>: Fewer junior positions may exist, making it harder to enter the field and build expertise — leading to a “hollowing out” of the profession.
	 </p></li>
<h3> <li>📚 Changing Skill Expectations</h3>
	 Employers are beginning to look for hybrid skills: AI prompt engineering, content automation, and API tooling.
	 <p> <b>Threat</b>: Writers who focus only on traditional writing and editing without adapting to AI-assisted workflows risk being seen as less relevant or less efficient.
	</p> </li>
<h3> <li>🧍 Commoditization of Writing</h3>
	 If AI-generated documentation is “good enough” for most users, companies may stop prioritizing human nuance, empathy, and clarity.
	 <p> <b>Threat</b>: The craft of clear, audience-focused writing may be undervalued, replaced by a quantity-over-quality mindset.

<section class="my-5" id="Limits">
<div class="container py-5">
    <h1> Limits of AI tools </h1>
<p> Some AI tools may require sources to be provided beforehand. However, giving them too many
sources can be counterproductive. An excess of information can affect the quality of the output and
lead to errors, commonly referred to as AI hallucinations. Therefore, it is important to know how to
limit the number of sources provided.</p>
<p>The optimal use of these tools is not very intuitive. They need to be guided and fed, sometimes
through multiple queries, to approach the desired result. It is important to know how to phrase
things correctly and to be very precise.</p>
<p>The result obtained is not always optimal. When summarizing a long document, essential
information may be omitted while less useful details are retained. The information they provide can
also be inaccurate.</p>
<p>Some(visual) creations of these tools are far from perfect (text errors in Gemini, structural issues
in ChatGPT).</p>
<p>It is not certain that the work produced fully adheres to ethical standards. ChatGPT provides
images sourced from the web without attribution. Using them without caution could constitute
plagiarism.</p>
<p>It is necessary to manually check, supplement, and correct the work produced.</p>
<p>It is also important to get into the habit of using two or more tools for the same task. For
example, one tool can generate instructions for a poster that will then be created by another.
Not everyone necessarily has these habits. As a result, some people may not be able to use these
tools optimally.</p>
<p>Another risk associated with these AI tools, in technical writing as elsewhere, is dependency.
Even if one knows how to use them optimally, there is a risk of relying on them too much and
forgetting that they can make mistakes and produce errors.</p>

<div class="container py-5">
    <h1> Future </h1>	
	
	<p>
While AI does threaten parts of the traditional technical writing role, it also creates new opportunities for those who adapt. Here are practical, strategic ways technical writers can protect and future-proof their careers in the AI era:
<ol>
 <h3> <li>
🧭 Shift from “Writer” to “Information Architect”</h3> 
AI can write text — but it struggles with structure, logic, and context across complex documentation systems.
You can stay indispensable by:
Designing information flows (how docs interconnect, how users navigate them).
Building and maintaining documentation frameworks (e.g., docs-as-code pipelines, version control, publishing automation).
Curating content taxonomies and metadata that make AI-generated docs usable and searchable.
Why this matters: AI still needs humans to define the architecture it writes within.
 </li>
 <h3> <li> 
🤝 Position Yourself as an AI Editor or Curator</h3> 
Instead of writing from scratch, become the human who:
Guides AI prompts for accurate technical content.
Reviews and corrects AI-generated drafts for clarity, accuracy, and compliance.
Trains AI models with high-quality examples and style guidance.
Why this matters: The future may favor AI-assisted documentation rather than AI-only — and skilled editors who ensure reliability will be essential.
 </li>
 <h3> <li>
🧰 Learn Tools Beyond Writing </h3>
Move up the stack — learn the technical tools and automation that drive documentation workflows:
Docs-as-code systems: Markdown, Git, CI/CD pipelines.
Static site generators: Docusaurus, Hugo, MkDocs.
APIs & SDKs: Understand how developers generate and use API docs.
Automation & AI tools: Familiarize yourself with ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Notion AI, or custom LLM workflows.
Why this matters: The more technical you are, the harder it is to replace you.
 </li>
 <h3> <li>
🧩 Develop Cross-Functional Communication Skills </h3>
AI can’t navigate people problems — but humans can. Strengthen your role as the bridge between developers, engineers, product managers, and end users.
Be the person who:
Extracts clear information from chaotic teams.
Clarifies ambiguous product features.
Advocates for user needs in documentation design.
Why this matters: Communication is an irreplaceable human differentiator.
 </li>
 <h3> <li>
📊  Add Value Through Strategy and Analytics </h3>
Move beyond documentation creation to documentation strategy:
Analyze usage metrics and user feedback.
Prioritize which content matters most.
Prove ROI of documentation (e.g., reduced support tickets).
Why this matters: Strategic writers are seen as partners in product success, not just content producers.
 </li>
<h3> <li>
💡  Learn AI Prompting and Customization </h3>
Treat AI as a collaborator, not a threat. Learn how to:
Write precise prompts to get reliable outputs.
Fine-tune or customize LLMs on your organization’s content.
Build prompt libraries or templates for consistent documentation generation.
Why this matters: Writers who manage AI workflows are more secure than those who compete with them.
 </li>
<h3> <li>
🌍 Embrace Specialization </h3>
General-purpose documentation is easiest for AI to handle. But highly technical, regulated, or safety-critical content still requires expert human oversight.
You can specialize in:
Regulatory or compliance writing (medical, aerospace, finance).
Security or DevOps documentation.
UX and developer experience (DX) writing.
Why this matters: The more specialized and critical your domain, the less replaceable you are.
 </li>
<h3> <li>
🧠 Cultivate Lifelong Learning </h3>
AI tools evolve rapidly — the most resilient professionals are those who keep up.
Stay active in:
Technical communication communities (Write the Docs, STC, Slack/Discord groups).
Learning AI trends and experimenting with tools.
Building a public portfolio showing your adaptability.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
🚀 Bottom Line
The threat is real — but so is the opportunity.
AI can automate documentation, but not understanding.
Those who evolve from “writers of text” to designers, strategists, editors, and AI collaborators will not only survive, but thrive.

<div class="container py-5">
    <h1> Conclusion </h1>
		<p> In conclusion, we remind you that AI tools can be a tremendous asset for technical writing
(researching documentation, providing guidance, producing various outputs…) and can save valuable
time.</p>
<p>However, it is important not to forget that they have limitations. Verifying the quality of their work
should be second nature. Trust does not replace control. One should also avoid becoming
dependent on these tools and trying to use them all the time.</p>
<p>We can conclude this presentation by saying that AI is not the future replacement for technical
writers. It is just another tool. Even if it becomes more advanced in the future, we do not believe it
will ever match the human brain.</p>
